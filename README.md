# How to setup a JS environment, by OpenAI

What is the best way to setup a development environment in JS using VS code, Git and Gihub? Could you explain the steps to follow, so I can do it? Also, please tell me how to display the results of my code? Should I install a local web server or is there alternative ways?

1. Install Visual Studio Code: Download and install Visual Studio Code from the official website.

2. Install Git: Download and install Git from the official website.

3. Configure Git: Configure Git with your username and email address.

4. Create a GitHub account: Create a GitHub account and create a repository for your project.

5. Clone the repository: Clone the repository to your local machine using the command line.

6. Install Node.js: Download and install Node.js from the official website.

7. Install npm: Install npm from the command line.

8. Install dependencies: Install any dependencies required for your project using npm.

9. Write code: Write your code in Visual Studio Code.

10. Commit and push: Commit and push your code to the GitHub repository.

11. Display results: To display the results of your code, you can either install a local web server or use a cloud-based service such as Heroku or Netlify.

For the last step, is there another way? For example, a mini web server in the form of a VS Code extension?

Yes, there are several VS Code extensions that provide a mini web server. Examples include Live Server, Web Server for Chrome, and Web Server.

Great, tell me more about how to use Live Server in VS Code.

Live Server is a VS Code extension that provides a mini web server for development purposes. To use it, you need to install the extension from the VS Code Marketplace. Once installed, you can launch the server by clicking the “Go Live” button in the bottom-right corner of the VS Code window. This will open a new browser window with your project running on the local server. You can then view and test your code in the browser.

Regarding step 7, anything I should know about how to use yarn, if I prefer yarn over npm? Can you give me an overview of the most widely used yarn commands, with examples?

The most widely used yarn commands are:

1. yarn init: This command initializes a new project and creates a package.json file.

Example: yarn init

2. yarn add: This command adds a package to the project.

Example: yarn add express

3. yarn remove: This command removes a package from the project.

Example: yarn remove express

4. yarn upgrade: This command upgrades a package to the latest version.

Example: yarn upgrade express

5. yarn run: This command runs a script from the package.json file.

Example: yarn run start

6. yarn install: This command installs all the dependencies listed in the package.json file.

Example: yarn install
